---

Using the Apache APISIX OpenID Connect plugin to configure Okta authentication is a simple three-step process. It allows you to switch from traditional authentication mode to centralized identity authentication mode. The following sections describe the steps to configure Okta authentication using the OpenID Connect plugin for Apache APISIX.

Centralized identity authentication mode, compared with traditional authentication mode, has the following advantages:

1. Centralized identity authentication simplifies the application development process.
1. Centralized identity authentication improves business security. 

## Prerequisite

Have an Okta account ready for use.

## Step 1: Configuring Okta

1. Log in to your Okta account, click "Create App Integration" to create an Okta application.
        ![Create App Integration](https://static.apiseven.com/202108/1629945284704-056f75ef-f726-4c62-8c4e-f491ba9ed35b.png)

1. Select the "OIDC- OpenID Connect" for Sign-in method, and select "Web Application" for Application type.
        ![Create a new App Integration](https://static.apiseven.com/202108/1629945322972-0a028f73-2cd8-4a84-9849-3e5d4f5c457b.png)

1. Set the redirect URL for login and logout.
        The "Sign-in redirect URIs" are the links that are allowed to be redirected after a successful login, and the "Sign-out redirect URIs" are the links that are redirected after a successful login. In this example, we set both the sign-in redirect and sign-out redirect URIs to http://127.0.0.1:9080/ .
        ![Set the redirect URL for login and logout](https://static.apiseven.com/202108/1629945355148-237e1fb7-f874-4a61-adeb-0e062f40cb03.png)

1. After finishing the settings, click "Save" to save the changes.

|set_id_token_header|true|Whether to carry the ID token in the X-ID-Token request header.|
|set_userinfo_header|true|Whether to carry user information in the X-Userinfo request header.|

```shell
curl  -XPOST 127.0.0.1:9080/apisix/admin/routes -H "X-Api-Key: edd1c9f034335f136f87ad84b625c8f1" -d '{
    "uri":"/*",
    "plugins":{
        "openid-connect":{
            "client_id":"{YOUR_CLIENT_ID}",
            "client_secret":"{YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET}",
            "discovery":"https://{YOUR_ISSUER}/.well-known/openid-configuration",

            "redirect_uri":"http://127.0.0.1:9080/"
        }
    },
    "upstream":{
        "type":"roundrobin",
        "nodes":{
            "httpbin.org:80":1
        }
    }
}'
```

## Verification

1. Visit "http://127.0.0.1:9080/get" and the page is redirected to the Okta login page because the OpenID Connect plugin is enabled.
    ![visit Okta login page](https://static.apiseven.com/202108/1629945757074-1340330d-1429-4f3f-bc8e-c89153acaec5.png)
1. Enter the username and password for the user's Okta account and click "Sign In" to log in to your Okta account.
1. After successful login, you can access the get page in "httpbin.org". The "httpbin.org/get" page will return the requested data with X-Access-Token,X-Id-Token, and X-Userinfo as follows.

  ```

**X-Access-Token**: Apache APISIX puts the access token obtained from the user provider into the X-Access-Token request header, optionally via the access_token_in_authorization_header in the plugin configuration Authorization request header.

![X-Access-Token](https://static.apiseven.com/202108/1629945782309-14f84210-6cf3-4618-9ed0-809701094872.png)

**X-Id-Token**: Apache APISIX will get the Id token from the user provider through the base64 encoding into the X-Id-Token request header, you can choose whether to enable this function through the set_id_token_header in the plugin configuration, the default is enabled.

![X-Id-Token](https://static.apiseven.com/202108/1629945819163-8751bf83-57a1-4278-8fbf-5379e6e81c58.png)

**X-Userinfo**: Apache APISIX will get the user information from the user provider and put it into X-Userinfo after encoding it with Base64, you can choose whether to enable this feature through set_userinfo_header in the plugin configuration, it is set to be on by default.

![X-Userinfo](https://static.apiseven.com/202108/1629945855914-012fbb0a-d65f-428e-8f46-621291ff9deb.png)

As you can see, Apache APISIX will carry the X-Access-Token, X-Id-Token, and X-Userinfo request headers to the upstream. The upstream can parse these headers to get the user IDid information and user metadata.

We have shown the process of building centralized identity authentication from Okta directly into the Apache APISIX Gateway. It is easy to sign up for a free Okta Developer Account to get started. Our approach reduces developer overhead and enables a safe and streamlined experience.

## About Okta

Okta is a customizable, secure, and drop-in solution to add authentication and authorization services to your applications. Get scalable authentication built right into your application without the development overhead, security risks, and maintenance that come from coding it yourself.
